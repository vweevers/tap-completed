# tap-completed

**Detect when [TAP](https://testanything.org/) output has completed.** Normally with [`tap-parser`](https://github.com/tapjs/tap-parser) the `complete` event fires only when the stream ends. This module detects and waits for the expected number of assertions and then ends the stream. This is an updated and API-compatible version of [`tap-finished`](https://github.com/substack/tap-finished); see differences below.

## Usage

```js
const completed = require('tap-completed')

const ws = completed(function (results) {
  console.log(results)
})

ws.write('TAP version 13')
ws.write('# my test')
ws.write('ok 1 hello world')
ws.write('ok 2 should be equal')
ws.write('1..2')
```

## Differences from `tap-finished`

- Upgraded `tap-parser` from 0.2.0 to 18
- Incorporates a fix by Julian Gruber ([substack/tap-finished#6](https://github.com/substack/tap-finished/pull/6))
- The `wait` period (see below) resets on a new incoming line.

## API

### `ws = completed([options][, callback])`

Returns a writable stream that consumes TAP. The callback will be called with the `results` from `tap-parser`, equivalent to:

```js
const completed = require('tap-completed')
const ws = completed().on('complete', callback)
```

Options:

- `wait` (number, default 1000): how long to wait for more output (like diagnostics) after the end was detected.

The stream is unfortunately not compatible with Node.js streams; it's best to treat it as its own interface and to read the source.

## Install

With [npm](https://npmjs.org) do:

```
npm install tap-completed
```
